Ferrari N.V. (NYSE:RACE) updated its long-term financial targets as part of its Capital Markets Day presentation on Thursday. The Italian automaker said it is aiming for strong growth and profitability through 2030.


In terms of guidance, the company expects net revenue to reach approximately €9.0 billion by 2030, representing a compound annual growth rate of around 5%, primarily driven by high-value sports cars, customized models, and other car-related activities sustained by a robust order book. Ferrari (NYSE:RACE) noted that its expanded product mix and increased personalization are expected to support the projected revenue growth.


Profitability targets for Ferrari (RACE) include achieving EBIT of at least €2.75 billion with a minimum margin of 30% in 2030, supported by the premium and limited-edition product lineup and enhanced personalization options. EBITDA is targeted at €3.6 billion or higher, with an EBITDA margin of at least 40%. Ferrari (RACE) noted that the targets reflect higher industrial costs, R&D, and marketing expenses to develop new products and expand the brand, which are anticipated to be offset by greater free cash flow generation.


Ferrari (RACE) forecasts cumulative industrial free cash flow of about €8.0 billion over 2026–2030, after accounting for capital expenditures of approximately €4.7 billion and other operating changes. The company noted that it has already surpassed its 2026 profitability milestones ahead of schedule and aims for cash conversion rates above 50%.
